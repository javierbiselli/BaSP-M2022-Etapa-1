# Week 02 - HTML

This html file is the landing page (desktop version) for TRACKGENIX SA

# Week 03 - CSS

This style.css file adds static style to the TRACKGENIX landing page 

# Week 04 - Responsive Design

These CSS files add style and responsiveness to the TRACKGENIX landing page using flexbox as the main design model and mobile first

- header.css is the top of the page. There are two different headers in Trackgenix landing page, one for mobile and tablet, and one for desktop resolutions. In the mobile version there are 2 elements, the tittle and the menu button. The tablet version adds the sidebar and the main logo, and the desktop version delete the logo image and logo, and replace them with the social network icons. These changes to the header are applied with media queries, making certain elements appear or disappear using display: none and display: inherit

- sidebar.css is the left bar of the page, it consists of a fixed box that changes width with different resolutions

- main.css contains the whole content of the page from the main section to the lists section, some elements here change from mobile and tablet to desktop, for example, the history section has buttons and less text in mobile and tablet than desktop, these changes are applied with media queries using display: none and display: inherit

- footer.css is the bottom of the page

- whole-page.css contains the styles that apply to the whole page, and the two media queries, one for tablet (768px), and one for desktop (1024px)

# Week 06 - DOM and Javascript

In this week I included the login and signup pages, both accesible through the sidebar menu (only in tablet and desktop versions).
The pages are responsive and every input in them contain validations to verify if the data provided by the user has a correct format. Also when you click or tap on the button on each page, a box appears below with the information provided by you on the inputs. If some input has an error, it will also show the error in this box.
Validations have been made with JavaScript logic and the elements are manipulated through JavaScript DOM. Responsiveness has been achived using flexbox as the main design model and mobile first
